<strong>tl;dr:</strong>
Sort of like my LinkedIn profile but with sentences.
</div>
<section class=body>
<div class=single>
<h2 id=locale>Locale</h2>
<p>Growing up on the west coast of Scotland and only having English as a
language (barely, some have noted), I sampled parts of the USA after graduating
before settling in Australia where I have stayed since 2009 (Sydney 2014—).</p>
<h2 id=master-of-none>Master of none</h2>
<p>Professionally I am fond of the saying <em>&ldquo;Jack of all trades, master of none&rdquo;</em>. I
suppose I feel it either reflects my staunch attempts to stay relevant as an
individual contributor or my pursuit of being ever more &ldquo;M&rdquo; shaped in my
discipline (literally speaking however, I am very much beanpole shaped). As a
compound sentence, though, I prefer the second clause because its connotation is
less presumptuous about me knowing the answer to something.</p>
<p>Career-wise I am a (recovering) enterprise Java person of many years currently
enjoying a prolonged excursion in the still nascent field of platform
engineering.</p>
<h3 id=platform-engineering>Platform Engineering</h3>
<p>As it has transpired, the upshot of spending my earlier career with a CRM
consultancy spruiking some fairly esoteric tech is that I have always built and
run my own stuff. Constructing production stacks on client sites from scratch
and subsequently owning the code deployed to them has always been a thing for
me; dedicated Ops teams a foreign concept.</p>
<p>I started as a product engineer but soon shifted to being across multiple teams
in a technical capacity either as a floating tech lead or architect (this title
having been prefixed with &ldquo;solutions&rdquo;, &ldquo;systems&rdquo;, and &ldquo;software&rdquo; depending on
the gig).</p>
<p>Around 2015 and on the back of what I jokingly refer to as the <em>great Australian
&ldquo;DevOps enterprise transformation movement&rdquo;</em>, I had the opportunity to lead
different kind of team. We were tasked with building out a self-servicable
hybrid cloud platform for other product engineers to consume—billed as an
internal Heroku at the time. ThoughtWorks would later call these teams <a href=https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/platform-engineering-product-teams>platform
product engineering teams</a> which I think is apt because if you are not treating
these things like internal products you <del>will</del> may have a bad time.</p>
<p>Anyway, my last two contracts have been at the helm of such teams building these
internal platforms from the ground up. Both times the task has been to enable
modern (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices>micro</a>-)SOAs atop secure and reliable cloud platform foundations that
have been tailored for easy self-service, continuous delivery and runtime
observability. The goal is always enabling product engineers to have acute focus
on business logic by having the platform handle as many non-differentiating,
cross-cutting concerns as is technically feasible.</p>
<p>So this is the sort of role I find myself in for the time being and there are
lots of organisations that need the help in this space. Nevertheless, at some
point I would like to return to true full-stack product engineering roles where
my customers are the organisation&rsquo;s customers.</p>
<h2 id=contact>Contact</h2>
<p>It might be helpful at this juncture to know that I do actually maintain the
industry-requisite <a href=https://linkedin.com/in/martinbaillie>LinkedIn</a> profile and keep the dot points somewhat aligned to
my movements.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I am also on <a href=https://keybase.io/martinbaillie>Twitter/Mastodon</a> but, fair warning, predominately as a
consumer and re-tweet/toot-er. If you are expecting smoking hot takes on why I
think your microservices are the wrong size or why you need Kubernetes and Istio
you will probably be disappointed. With that said, I do enjoy shooting the
breeze about tech and my DMs are open, as they say. I can be reached by other
means too (see: footer).</p>
<h2 id=this-site>This Site</h2>
<p>The main purpose of this site is to surface what I have opted to call
<em><a href=/wrote/fieldnotes>Fieldnotes</a></em>.</p>
<p>Because I switch my own system themes depending on the time of day, this site
likewise has a dark and light theme. It is automatically chosen based on your
system preference but you can override with the wee icon at the top right.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the slightly brutalist design, I&rsquo;ll strive to keep this site
otherwise as accessible as possible, and respecting of your privacy. If you
think I am dropping the ball on this please let me know.</p>
