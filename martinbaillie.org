** Locale
Growing up on the west coast of Scotland and only having English as a
language (barely, some have noted), I sampled parts of the USA after graduating
before settling in Australia where I have stayed since 2009 (Sydney 2014—).
** Master of none
Professionally I am fond of the saying /"Jack of all trades, master of none"/. I
suppose I feel it either reflects my staunch attempts to stay relevant as an
individual contributor or my pursuit of being ever more "M" shaped in my
discipline (literally speaking however, I am very much beanpole shaped). As a
compound sentence, though, I prefer the second clause because its connotation is
less presumptuous about me knowing the answer to something.

Career-wise I am a (recovering) enterprise Java person of many years currently
enjoying a prolonged excursion in the still nascent field of platform
engineering.

*** Platform Engineering
As it has transpired, the upshot of spending my earlier career with a CRM
consultancy spruiking some fairly esoteric tech is that I have always built and
run my own stuff. Constructing production stacks on client sites from scratch
and subsequently owning the code deployed to them has always been a thing for
me; dedicated Ops teams a foreign concept.

I started as a product engineer but soon shifted to being across multiple teams
in a technical capacity either as a floating tech lead or architect (this title
having been prefixed with "solutions", "systems", and "software" depending on
the gig).

Around 2015 and on the back of what I jokingly refer to as the /great Australian
"DevOps enterprise transformation movement"/, I had the opportunity to lead
different kind of team. We were tasked with building out a self-servicable
hybrid cloud platform for other product engineers to consume—billed as an
internal Heroku at the time. ThoughtWorks would later call these teams [[https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/platform-engineering-product-teams][platform
product engineering teams]] which I think is apt because if you are not treating
these things like internal products you +will+ may have a bad time.

Anyway, my last two contracts have been at the helm of such teams building these
internal platforms from the ground up. Both times the task has been to enable
modern ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices][micro]]-)SOAs atop secure and reliable cloud platform foundations that
have been tailored for easy self-service, continuous delivery and runtime
observability. The goal is always enabling product engineers to have acute focus
on business logic by having the platform handle as many non-differentiating,
cross-cutting concerns as is technically feasible.

So this is the sort of role I find myself in for the time being and there are
lots of organisations that need the help in this space. Nevertheless, at some
point I would like to return to true full-stack product engineering roles where
my customers are the organisation's customers.

** Contact
It might be helpful at this juncture to know that I do actually maintain the
industry-requisite [[https://linkedin.com/in/martinbaillie][LinkedIn]] profile and keep the dot points somewhat aligned to
my movements.

Otherwise, I am also on [[https://keybase.io/martinbaillie][Twitter/Mastodon]] but, fair warning, predominately as a
consumer and re-tweet/toot-er. If you are expecting smoking hot takes on why I
think your microservices are the wrong size or why you need Kubernetes and Istio
you will probably be disappointed. With that said, I do enjoy shooting the
breeze about tech and my DMs are open, as they say. I can be reached by other
means too (see: footer).
** This Site
The main purpose of this site is to surface what I have opted to call
/[[/wrote/fieldnotes][Fieldnotes]]/.

Because I switch my own system themes depending on the time of day, this site
likewise has a dark and light theme. It is automatically chosen based on your
system preference but you can override with the wee icon at the top right.

Notwithstanding the slightly brutalist design, I'll strive to keep this site
otherwise as accessible as possible, and respecting of your privacy. If you
think I am dropping the ball on this please let me know.

:END:
Well here we are! I had held off from spewing words onto the internet in
long-form until now. That I have made it this far with a new site and first post
has been the culmination of:

1. The compound guilt felt as a practiced user of other people's technical
   writing to my professional advantage.
2. The accidental consumption of multiple /"why you should write a technical
   blog"/-themed posts in quickfire succession from my feeds.
3. The turn of a new year (though I won't go as far as to say it is a
  resolution).

I have opted to refer to the writing section /Fieldnotes/ as because I predict
the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldnotes][definition]] will best represent the style of content that will unfold. That
is, the posts will likely be overwhelmingly technical in nature and cover
something I have learned or been playing with recently in the hope that someone
else finds some value in it or, at the very least, help me to better understand
the topic by way of the Feynman technique.

I personally prefer reading posts with technical content. The same goes for
conference presentations as it happens (especially those that dare to live
demo). So while I can't promise I won't waffle on in the posts, I will commit to
most or all of them having something technically concrete to add to the greater
internet—new OSS releases, how-tos, gotchas and so on. I've even added a =tl;dr=
construct to help the reader decide if they will get value from the gist.

If nothing else, I'm looking forward to having a space to share content and
contact information in a decentralised manner, off social platforms. I've made
the promise to myself that I'll keep the writing consistent for at least a year
and I'm optimistic that the posts will be more coherent and valuable to me than
just another random =.org= file in my Dropbox.

The site itself is generated with an old familiar: [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] (even though I'm reading
good things about [[https://www.getzola.org/][Zola]]). I've used Hugo for many years to produce internal
documentation sites at my day jobs. There's also something to be said about the
special synergy you get when combining Hugo and Emacs Org mode ([[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]]). Well
maybe there is something to be said. If I do manage to keep this up then I'm
sure I will write one of those clichéd meta posts about the whole build and
deploy setup, or at least a colophon section.

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: ephemeral-github-tokens-via-hashicorp-vault
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :tldr Improve your GitHub security posture with a Vault plugin.
:END:
*** GitHub
I have found that performing automation against GitHub APIs often necessitates
the creation of [[https://help.github.com/en/github/extending-github/git-automation-with-oauth-tokens][OAuth Tokens]] (nb. GitHub refers to these as Personal Access
Tokens or PATs). These tokens are tied to a user account, have /very/
coarsely-scoped permissions and do not expire.

The more automation-savvy users in an organisation will likely have created many
such tokens with powerful permissions which are being neither rotated nor
deleted.

The organisation will also commonly have wasted at least one of their GitHub
seats on a [[https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/types-of-github-accounts#personal-user-accounts][robot/machine user]] for CI/CD purposes. These users share similar
access token and SSH key fates as the human users do but additionally need their
credentials managed and rotated on their behalf (a feat that is arguably made
even more awkward when federating GitHub access through an third party IdP).

-----

[[https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/][GitHub Apps]] offer a better approach to this automation problem:
1. They do not consume a seat (license) nor need credential management.
2. They have /much/ finer-grained [[https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/permissions/][permissions]] available to the access tokens.
3. The tokens they issue expire after an hour.

However, and this is the tricky part, GitHub Apps require the management of at
least one private key used to mint the JWTs used for the [[https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation][App installation
authentication]] token request flow.
*** Vault
I am a big fan of HashiCorp's [[https://www.vaultproject.io/][Vault]] product. I think it is a versatile security
tool for an organisation to have in their armoury and I have been intimately
involved with getting it deployed on my last two contracts.

Sure, over the years I've seen some of its feature set being tackled by the
major clouds as one might expect, and as a platform guy I'm always weighing up
managed services in a perpetual quest to run less non-differentiating
infrastructure. However, in my opinion Vault is still very much worth it if you
have a range of security requirements needing solved. Nothing comes close to its
range nor flexibility. It is also not inconceivable for HashiCorp to eventually
offer it as a managed service themselves (ala. Terraform Cloud) or otherwise
partner with the major clouds on doing so.

Anyhow, it's that flexibility that really shines here. An organisation's Vault
deployment is (or at least *should* be) one of the most secure systems in their
landscape and storing secrets is its bread and butter. What a perfect home for
that GitHub App private key from earlier!

But then, if a private key exists in the woods, can anyone +hear it+ use it to
sign a JWT?

Let's take a gander at some other useful security aspects of that organisation's
Vault deployment:
- Auth backends


  The organisation's preferred authZ/N backends are presumably already
  configured. Vault supports a multitude of these, including but not exclusive
  to: any OIDC compliant IdP, all major cloud IAM, LDAP, Kubernetes, TLS and
  even GitHub (for those chicken-and-egg vibes).

- Secret backends


  A pluggable secrets backend construct with CRUD-mapped RESTful semantics
  fronted by the same highly available API protected by those auth backends.
  There's even the concept of secret leases.

- RBAC


  Strong declarative identity and unified ACL concept permeated throughout
  all actions in the API surface.

*** Vault<>GitHub plugin
So, if you have clocked on to my thinly veiled setup, it logically follows that
someone might try to marry these Vault security strengths with a GitHub App to
plug the perceived GitHub PAT weakness, and that is exactly what I've done with
[[https://github.com/martinbaillie/vault-plugin-secrets-github][=vault-plugin-secrets-github=]].

Using this plugin you can broker requests to a GitHub App through Vault:
#+attr_html: :alt Vault GitHub Plugin
[[./img/vault_github_plugin.png]]

Here the user authenticates with Vault and makes a request to the plugin's
configured mount point. This is a projected request that can include any manner
of GitHub [[https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/reference/permissions-required-for-github-apps][permissions]] or repository IDs.

The plugin then mints a JWT from the securely stashed private key and uses it to
ask the installed GitHub App for a token constrained by those same permissions and/or repository IDs.

Presuming the App is configured with the superset of the requested permissions,
an access token is granted by GitHub and is valid for 1 hour. It can be used for
GitHub API and remote authenticated =git= operations, and the plugin can work
with either GitHub SaaS or Enterprise editions.

#+begin_quote
Full installation instructions and API spec are kept up-to-date in the [[https://github.com/martinbaillie/vault-plugin-secrets-github][README]].
#+end_quote

**** Permissions
For now, unless you mount the plugin many times each for a different use case
(i.e. many GitHub Apps), you will need to give your primary GitHub App the
superset of all anticipated permissions needed by your users. This is /still/
better than those users being allowed to create their own PATs because the
plugin issued tokens only last for an hour.

In any case, you now arguably have a much stronger RBAC system at your disposal:
Vault's.

It is possible to craft tight Vault policies to constrain user capabilities on
the GitHub plugin (and by extension GitHub), and then map that to your Vault
user/role structure however you see fit.

-----

As an example, imagine I have deployed the plugin to my Vault and I have
configured the associated GitHub App to have access to all repositories as well
as full write permissions on GitHub's =administration=, =contents=, =issues= and
=pull_requests= APIs.

Since Vault is deny by default, no authenticated user can access the
=/github/token= plugin endpoint until permissive policy is attached.

Suppose I then wanted to allow a user to have GitHub API access, but only to
create pull requests on the repository ID =69857131=. I would first craft a
policy that encapsulates this use case.
#+begin_src shell
; vault policy write github-only-prs - <<EOF
path "github/token" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
  required_parameters = ["permissions","repository_ids"]
  allowed_parameters = {
    "repository_ids" = ["69857131"]
    "permissions"= ["pull_requests=write"]
  }
}
EOF
#+end_src
My policy mandates that both =permissions= and =repository_ids= parameters are
present and that they have certain fixed values.

I would then attach the policy to a user or group construct in my Vault setup.
#+begin_src shell
; vault auth enable userpass
; vault write auth/userpass/users/martin password=baillie policies="github-only-prs"
#+end_src

This contrived user would then only be able to send that exact stipulated
request to Vault.
#+begin_src shell
# Login.
; vault login -method=userpass username=martin password=baillie
# Successfully create a token.
; vault write /github/token repository_ids=69857131 permissions=pull_requests=write
# Permission denied:
; vault write -f /github/token
; vault write /github/token permissions=pull_requests=write
; vault write /github/token repository_ids=69857131 permissions=administration=read
; vault write /github/token repository_ids=123 permissions=pull_requests=write
; vault write /github/token repository_ids=69857131
#+end_src
**** Metrics
David Wheeler's age-old aphorism, aka. the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_software_engineering]["fundamental theorem of software
engineering"]]/ goes:
#+begin_quote
"All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection."
#+end_quote

And here we are once again proxying network requests for profit. At least we can
use it to our advantage by gleaning better insight into how the organisation is
utilising GitHub automation through metrics—something else that GitHub's audit
log falls short on.

Notwithstanding Vault's own audit log which enumerates all API access in detail
(/and you do have this streaming to some kind of SIEM product, right?/), the
GitHub plugin also offers up an additional metrics endpoint in the
Prometheus/OpenMetrics exposition format. Details are in the [[https://github.com/martinbaillie/vault-plugin-secrets-github#metrics][README]] and a sample
Grafana [[https://github.com/martinbaillie/vault-plugin-secrets-github/blob/master/dashboard.json][dashboard]] is provided.

:END:
*** Tailscale
A service called [[https://tailscale.com][Tailscale]] launched at the beginning of the month and promises
to be the /"easiest, most secure way to use WireGuard and 2FA"/.

As an early beta tester of [[https://www.wireguard.com/][WireGuard]] and someone who has been carefully tracking
its progress towards mainline Linux (currently in =net-next=, [[https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=WireGuard-Net-Next-Lands][scheduled for
5.6]]!), I am especially excited to see people much smarter than me start to build
next generation VPN businesses centred around it.

WireGuard will allow the Tailscale folks to eschew traditional hub-and-spoke VPN
models and have their customers construct their own private meshed (P2P)
networks. This is similar in a sense to the features offered up by [[https://www.zerotier.com/][ZeroTier]] or
what you might be able to presumably cobble together with the likes of Slack's
recently announced [[https://slack.engineering/introducing-nebula-the-open-source-global-overlay-network-from-slack/][Nebula]], though neither are based on WireGuard.

If Tailscale is executed well it could bring WireGuard to the masses and
hopefully even usher in a bit of a paradigm shift for cloud networking:
decentralised [[https://beyondcorp.com/][BeyondCorp-styled]] zero trust networking for the rest of us. That
is, looking past perimeter-based security and not just for the usual case of
privileged staff access. Why continue to build our backend SOAs out of all these
layered VPCs with their NACLs, security groups and reverse proxying load
balancers when some smart DNS and meshed WireGuard tunnels will suffice?

Anyway, idealist gushing aside, they do have their work cut out. The hard part
in all of this is not the WireGuard data plane, but the control plane that
manages it. I had a small side project going at work last year to allow temporal
privileged access to cloud resources for our platform engineers using WireGuard,
and solving the keypair distribution/rotation and tunnel auto-configuration for
multiple OSes was /not/ trivial! For Tailscale there's also the issue of IAM /
2FA, DNS support and not least the tedious NAT traversal tricks that will be
required for them to become a universally useful end-user SaaS. Good luck to
them!
*** Support for OpenBSD

I've been using [[https://www.openbsd.org/][OpenBSD]] on and off since I was a teenager. It is without a doubt
my favourite OS, and while I don't use it as my daily driver anymore, it has
remained steadfast at the helm of my [[https://github.com/martinbaillie/homebrew-openbsd-pcengines-router][homebrew router]] for many years.

I've also been using WireGuard to interconnect all of my machines for a while,
but after switching them over to Tailscale last week my OpenBSD router was a
/notable omission/.

-----

Fret not! Thankfully Tailscale's core is open source and on [[https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale][GitHub]]. It happened
to utilise the same [[https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go/about/][=wireguard-go=]] userspace library I was already familiar with
from my work side project. Happily, they accepted my [[https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/pull/36][pull request]] and now
Tailscale knows OpenBSD!

#+attr_html: :alt OpenBSD support for Tailscale
#+attr_html: :width 50%
[[./img/tailscale_openbsd.png]]

Fair warning, it does not take advantage of OpenBSD's standout [[https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2][=pledge(2)=]] /
[[https://man.openbsd.org/unveil][=unveil(2)=]] security features yet but it should be able to given Go has the
requisite syscall support ([[https://github.com/golang/sys/blob/master/unix/pledge_openbsd.go][pledge]], [[https://github.com/golang/sys/blob/master/unix/unveil_openbsd.go][unveil]]).

The rest of this post will go into how you can get yourself hooked upto
Tailscale from an OpenBSD userspace.

*** Installing Tailscale on OpenBSD
There is no native WireGuard in the OpenBSD kernel yet, and anyway Tailscale
runs off a temporary fork of the [[https://github.com/tailscale/wireguard-go][=wireguard-go=]] implementation for now (which,
incidentally, also means you cannot use the upstream version from OpenBSD's
ports).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
20200621 UPDATE: WireGuard has since landed natively in OpenBSD-CURRENT as
[[https://man.openbsd.org/wg.4][=wg(4)=]]! I have yet to have a play but it will be in 6.8-STABLE.
#+END_QUOTE

So, and accepting the arguably negligible hit for crossing the kernel<>userspace
border for each packet, the first thing you'll want to do is grab the latest
Tailscale source code for local compilation.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
; git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale.git
#+END_SRC

You will also need a sufficiently modern Go toolchain (but do not necessarily
need to be on an OpenBSD host).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
20201012 UPDATE: As I rebuilt to latest Tailscale for my own router I noticed
their repository has changed slightly. I've updated the following instructions
to match the current structure as of this date.
#+END_QUOTE

Build OpenBSD compatible Tailscale binaries and move them to your target machine
(presuming you're not already on it):
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
; cd tailscale
; GOOS=openbsd go build ./cmd/tailscale
; GOOS=openbsd go build ./cmd/tailscaled
; scp tailscale{,d} root@openbsd:/usr/local/bin
#+END_SRC

On OpenBSD, =tailscaled= will correctly use =/var/db/tailscale= as its state
directory and =/var/run/tailscale/tailscale.sock= for its UNIX socket.

This is the rc script I use (=/etc/rc.d/tailscaled=). Don't forget to make it
executable!
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
#!/bin/ksh
daemon="/usr/local/bin/tailscaled"

. /etc/rc.d/rc.subr

rc_start() {
    ${rcexec} "${daemon} ${daemon_flags} 2>&1 | logger -t tailscaled &"
}

rc_cmd $1
#+END_SRC

Pair this with an entry in =/etc/rc.conf.local=, optionally passing any
Tailscale daemon flags (or use =rcctl enable tailscaled=):
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
tailscaled_flags=""
#+END_SRC

Start the daemon to make sure it is working:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
; doas rcctl start tailscaled
# tailscaled(ok)
#+END_SRC

And that's it! You should have Tailscale logs streaming in =/var/log/messages=
and have a plumbed =tunX= device by now.

I've had my Tailscale state db configured for a while, but if you see
authentication errors in the logs then you may need to run an initial:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
; tailscale up
#+END_SRC

I have been [[/wrote/tailscale-support-for-openbsd][continuing]] to run with Tailscale instead of hand-cranked WireGuard
on various devices, including my daily driver ThinkPad which runs my /other/
favourite OS—[[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]]!

However, until now the configuration was not particularly idiomatic due to there
being no upstream Tailscale Nix expressions in [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs][nixpkgs]].

As it transpired, Dan Anderson of Tailscale is also a NixOS user and with his
support I was able to shepherd in a [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/82537][quick PR]] to introduce a Tailscale [[https://search.nixos.org/options?query=tailscale][module]]. I
actually think NixOS ended up being their first Linux flavoured package!

Like the previous OpenBSD post, the rest of this post will walk you through how
to set up Tailscale on NixOS.
*** Installing Tailscale on NixOS
It's simple!
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
services.tailscale.enable = true;

# Optional (default: 41641):
services.tailscale.port = 12345;
#+END_SRC

You can choose to make it easier for Tailscale by opening up the UDP port.
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
networking.firewall.allowedUDPPorts = [ ${services.tailscale.port} ];
#+END_SRC

Depending on your setup, you may need to make the =tailscale= CLI available to
all users.
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ tailscale ];
#+END_SRC

That's the configuration out of the way. If you perform a =rebuild-switch=, you
should find a Tailscale daemon running.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
; systemctl status tailscale
#+END_SRC

Finally, perform an initial authentication for this machine and you're done.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
; tailscale up
#+END_SRC

You should be able to see a successfully plumbed device, and Tailscale logs
scrolling.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
; ip link show tailscale0
; journalctl -fu tailscale

*** Nix
Early last year, after teetering on the edge for a while, I finally took the
plunge into the world of [[https://nixos.org][Nix]]. It always seemed to be the logical conclusion to
my declarative over imperative leanings and it has not disappointed.

I would classify myself as a semi-retired OS [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding][bikeshedder]] these days. I no longer
obsess over [[https://old.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/themeing/dictionary#wiki_rice][ricing]] my prompt nor switch tiling WMs like they're going out of
style. Instead, my prompt is a simple exit code coloured semi-colon and I spend
the majority of time in either Firefox or Emacs (+vterm). On NixOS I am using
the Sway Wayland compositor and on macOS I am usually just running native
fullscreen, ⌘↹ing between the two previously mentioned apps.

All in, this means my recent [[https://github.com/martinbaillie/dotfiles][dotfiles]] are much less sprawling than they have
been in the past and were therefore easy to convert to Nix expressions.

The expressions are organised into platform-agnostic "modules" that leverage the
likes of the [[https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs][nixpkgs]], [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][home-manager]] and [[https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin][nix-darwin]] channels to fully configure
the OS and userspace from scratch.

On top of basic software provisioning Nix expressions, I've written a simple
theming system that I use to switch various things between light and dark mode,
and a "secrets" attribute set (kept encrypted in a private repository) is used to
wire secrets throughout.

I'm very happy with the result. The expressions work flawlessly between NixOS
and macOS, and I'm able to go from fresh install to /mise en place/ with the
flick of a [[https://github.com/martinbaillie/dotfiles/blob/master/Makefile][=Makefile=]] target. I might try to find the time to convert my so-called
modules to proper boolean flagged, [[https://search.nixos.org/options][nixpkgs-styled options]], and the [[https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/49][Flakes RFC]]
looks very promising and solves my main criticism of Nix, but otherwise I am
feeling pretty zen about it all with no immediate desire to touch things (for a
change!).
*** Continuous Integration
Something I could not find many people doing, publicly at least, was building
their Nix dotfile repositories on push using the popular free CI services.

There are many ways to skin this cat but my approach was to build as native to
the target environment as I can get. Currently this looks like a combination of:
+ GitHub Actions (macOS)
GitHub Actions are great and have generous amounts of free macOS minutes on true
Apple hardware-based runners, so this was a no brainer.

+ Travis CI (NixOS, by way of QEMU)
Alas, GitHub do not provide access to underlying hardware virtualisation on
their SaaS Actions runners (at least at the time of writing this), and their
Linux runners are exclusively Ubuntu to boot. Since I really want to build a
NixOS VM to truly test every aspect of my expressions this means switching up to
Travis for these builds.

**** Building
My parlour trick for covering all bases is to generate a special CI machine that
imports every one of my modules:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
{ pkgs, lib, ... }:
# For CI, import every module but select a single theme, ultimately testing both
# themes over the course of the NixOS and macOS CI runs. Also filter out any
# system specific modules that are not for the current system.
let
  inherit (builtins) readDir concatLists filter match;
  inherit (lib) mapAttrsToList hasSuffix;
  inherit (lib.systems.elaborate { system = builtins.currentSystem; }) isLinux;
  nixFilesIn = dir:
    let
      children = readDir dir;
      f = path: type:
        let absPath = dir + "/${path}";
        in if type == "directory" then
          nixFilesIn absPath
        else if hasSuffix ".nix" (baseNameOf path) then
          [ absPath ]
        else
          [ ];
    in concatLists (mapAttrsToList f children);
  modules = filter (n:
    match
    ("(.*/themes/.*|.*." + (if isLinux then "darwin" else "linux") + ".nix$)")
    (toString n) == null) (nixFilesIn <modules>);
  theme = (if isLinux then <modules/themes/light> else <modules/themes/dark>);
in { imports = [ ../../. theme ] ++ modules; }
#+END_SRC
Using this pseudo machine, I can derive either a NixOS VM (via QEMU) on Travis
or simply build on a fresh Darwin Actions runner VM (in the case of macOS). Over
the course of both builds combined, all my Nix expressions are exercised.

#+begin_src make
# CI targets.
# $(GITHUB_ACTIONS) == true
# $(TRAVIS) == true

	&& $(MAKE) test HOSTNAME=ci
endif
.PHONY: ci
#+end_src
**** Caching
The resultant binaries are pushed to Cachix and subsequently become available
for any of my other machines thus saving a lot of wasted CPU cycles!

:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: evil-motion-training-for-emacs
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :tldr Punish yourself for poorly chosen evil motions in Emacs.
:END:
I made the switch to Emacs last year after having been a resolute vim user ever
since I dual booted Slackware on my family's first computer as an early teen.

Needless to say the power of the Emacs pseudo [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine][lisp machine]] quickly opened my
eyes. I immediately lunged into consolidating practically all my text use cases
sans browsing into Emacs: programming, note taking, RSS, mail, =git= porcelain,
GitHub PRs and issues, IRC/Slack. I even entirely replaced my use of a separate
terminal emulator. My browser has since clawed back the mail, Slack and /some/
GitHub use cases from Emacs' grasp, but if it weren't for me staunchly trying to
stick to Wayland I am quite sure I'd be writing this from inside [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]] by now.

However, the old adage goes:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Emacs is a great operating system missing a great editor."
#+END_QUOTE

And it was true for me, but fixable.

*** Evil Mode

I tried Emacs native key chords for all of a day or two before giving up and
enabling [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][evil mode]]. It could be that I'm too far gone, but I simply could not
live without modal editing and the intuitive verb-object =vi= key bindings that I
had become accustomed to.

For me, having [[*Proficiency][proficiency]] at moving around a buffer and manipulating text in
this manner means anything else feels like a bit of a regression. What's more,
I've always used =vi= styled bindings anywhere I can, be it in terminal readline
mode, my tiling window manager [[https://swaywm.org/][du jour]], or Firefox ([[https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl][Tridactyl]] is my pick of the
post-[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL][XUL era]] bunch). Even back in my enterprise Java days, when forced to dip into
the heavyweight IDE world with the likes of Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA, I'd still
reach for a plugin.

-----

I think with evil mode and Emacs you're truly getting the best of both worlds.
Emacs can be the great editor (neo)vi(m) is. It can be just as snappy (see
[[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GccEmacs][native-comp]]), start just as fast (see [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsClient][emacsclient]] / [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom]]'s optimisations), and
has all the modern trimmings you would expect in an editor (e.g. [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][LSP]], [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2019-06/msg00123.html][ligatures]],
[[https://github.com/masm11/emacs][pgtk]]).

It is, however, the famed Emacs extensibility that sets it apart from the crowd
for me. Vimscript, Neovim's Lua extensions, even VSCode's extensions API are—to
butcher [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule][Greenspun's aphorism]]—just /ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden,
slow implementations of half of/ +Common Lisp+ /Elisp/.

With Elisp packages, Emacs can become a cybernetic extension of your arm. Though
package authors are not really writing an extension, they're just writing more
Emacs. That, I think, is the crux of it.

Speaking of packages, there are of course all the usual big hitter packages that
you'll find on any list, like [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]], [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]], [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode][TRAMP]], [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]], [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]] and [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredMode][Dired]] to
name a few. However, today I'm showcasing a small package to improve proficiency
in evil motions.

*** Proficiency
Not long before my switch to Emacs I had started trying to kick some bad habits
with vim. Let's call them lazy motions. I /knew/ better ways of moving the
cursor from a to b, but the cognitive overhead, or lack of muscle memory
perhaps, was too much to overcome. If you're also a vim user then there's a
chance you know what I mean: =hhhhhhhhhhhhjjjjjjjjkkkkkllllhjk=. That is,
favouring a single character/line oriented movement over a more esoteric (but
known to you!) and undeniably precise movement.

The word-wise motions (e.g. =wW=, =bB=, =eE=, =ge=), character searches (e.g.
=fF=, =tT=, =,=, =;=) and line jumps (e.g. =10j= =5k=) will almost always get
you where you want to be with less keystrokes.

I was slowly beginning to fix this through a somewhat Pavlovian vim plugin
called [[https://github.com/takac/vim-hardtime][=vim-hardtime=]] which would tase me when I repeatedly used these keys in
succession. Unfortunately I lost this with the switch to Emacs and the return to
familiar modal surroundings in evil mode, and sure enough the bad habits came
back.

To my dismay I could not find a directly equivalent Emacs package so today I'm
releasing the [[https://github.com/martinbaillie/evil-motion-trainer][=evil-motion-trainer=]] on GitHub.

*** Evil Motion Trainer
Just like the vim plugin, entering =evil-motion-trainer-mode= means Emacs will
drop lazily repeated hjkl-based motions after a configurable threshold, forcing
you to think about a more efficient motion:

[[./img/evil_motion_trainer.gif]]
**** Configuration
Enable in a buffer with:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(evil-motion-trainer-mode)
#+END_SRC

Turn on for all buffers:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(global-evil-motion-trainer-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

Configure the number of permitted repeated key presses:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq evil-motion-trainer-threshold 6)
#+END_SRC

Enable a super annoying mode that pops a warning in a buffer:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq evil-motion-trainer-super-annoying-mode t)
#+END_SRC

Add to the suggested alternatives for a key:

*** WASM
I have had a renewed interest in WASM ever since I read the Mozilla WASI
[[https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/][announcement]] and some of its supporting literature. A few things clicked for me
after that, most prominently the potential for use beyond the browser. The
compile once, run anywhere aspects echo the Linux container revolution of the
last decade, but with true sandboxing, faster starts and without the baggage of
a Linux userspace.

The poster child of that revolution was of course Docker. It arguably ushered in
a new paradigm for packaging and deploying software to cloud and enterprise
computing landscapes that was both efficient and cost-effective. Sure, the
backing company is an omnishambles, but its tech concepts live on in various
forms.

Docker achieved all of this despite not being the first to utilise the Linux
kernel's =cgroups(7)= and =namespaces(7)= features in a cohesive manner, nor Linux even
being the first to offer such virtualised isolation at all. Other OSes have
famously had similar offerings since the early noughties, notably FreeBSD's
[[https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails.html][Jails]] and Solaris' [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_Containers][Zones]] (which hold a special place in my heart from my time
interning at Sun).

So why, then, did Docker beat the others? The answer I often see touted
elsewhere and that I personally believe is */developer experience/*. It
democratised those Linux container primitives through an abstraction, provided a
simplistic product engineer focused CLI workflow, and defined an immutable image
format solving for the /"works on my machine"/ problem. Those product engineers
could now build, ship and run their workloads on any server with a Docker
daemon.

WASI implementers will face this same hurdle to become successful on the server,
but can benefit from being more integrated to tooling and platforms. This can
already be seen with the burgeoning support for compile targets in the
toolchains of languages like Rust, C++, Go and AssemblyScript (a TypeScript
subset), as well as edge compute platforms like Fastly's Lucet and Cloudflare's
Workers, Ethereum through [[https://ewasm.readthedocs.io/en/mkdocs/][eWasm]] and even good ol' Kubernetes through [[https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet][Krustlet]].

> Incidentally, Krustlet now supports multiple providers ([[https://wasmtime.dev/][Wasmtime]], [[https://wascc.dev/][waSCC]]) but
I view this (in keeping with the container metaphor) as being less analogous
to the orchestration system wars of Kubernetes/Mesos/Rancher/Swarm/Nomad and
more to container runtime e.g. Docker/runc/CRI-O/Rocket. Wasmtime aims for
strict adherence to WASI, and waSCC is an interesting approach based on the
Actor model, though I'm not clear on its relationship to the WASI spec.

*** Envoy
Envoy has supported WASM extensions for a while now (even predating WASI, but
there are plans afoot to re-align). It does this by implementing the
=proxy-wasm= [[https://github.com/proxy-wasm/spec][spec]], an open standard ABI for interoperability between WASM VMs
and a host proxy. The idea being that in the future if a great extension exists
for say HAProxy, then it would also be usable in Envoy, Nginx and any other
proxy also implementing this spec. An ambitious venture for sure.

Anyway, Envoy is leading the charge on this by a long shot at the moment and
this is useful for me because it is fast becoming the universal data plane for
services meshes, including the one we operate at my current gig as our platform
SOA backbone: Istio.

Being early adopters of Istio we now have a few hundred services in our
platform's mesh. We built the platform atop Kubernetes and have found the pod a
useful axiom for offering cross-cutting functionality to our users through the
sidecar pattern. For example: injecting secrets, pub/sub over CloudEvents or
rotating DB credentials.

Taking care of common technological concerns like these allow our users to have
increased focus on building differentiating product features.

-----

Now, to automatically bolt-on these functional building blocks we invariably
utilise Kubernetes controllers or mutating webhooks to inject /*additional*/
containers alongside the "primary" container during admission. To make that
concrete to the more Kubernetes-initiated reader, =6/6 Running= is not an
uncommon sight in a =kubectl get pods= output from our platform.

Despite the overwhelming majority of the sidecars we write (or reuse from the
community) being in Go, and even after careful attention being paid to ensuring
low and stable resource requirements, they do still add up. This is especially
true when you have large clusters full of workloads utilising them (a curse of
success I suppose).

However, since we are using Istio there is another avenue that avoids additional
containers (for bolting on network related functionality at least) and that is
the /*Envoy filter*/.

**** Envoy Filters
In an Istio-enabled pod there is a necessary Envoy sidecar container (so if
you're following, that's =2/2 Running= on our platform by default!). It acts as
the gatekeeper to the pod's network thanks to a Kubernetes CNI plugin
manipulating the pod =iptables=. So all pod packets ingress and egress route
through that Envoy, and Envoy filters can be used manipulate them as they
traverse the proxy's internal network and application protocol processing stack.

It is worth mentioning that Envoy has a strong catalogue of native [[https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/http_filters][filters]]
available and Istio in turn has facilities for enabling them through the
[[https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/envoy-filter/][=EnvoyFilter=]] CRD. So that should always be your first port of call. But what do
you do if you have a use case that is not covered in a native filter?

You have two options:
1. Write a new filter into Envoy's source and compile a custom version.

    This is tried and true, but requires you to maintain a custom supply chain
   for Envoy and keep it rebased. You are also limited to C++ in terms of
   languages (unless you get creative) given that is what Envoy is written in.

2. Write a new filter and dynamically load it at runtime using a WASM VM.

    This is why I'm writing this fieldnote today. Doing this is becoming
   increasingly accessible to your average Joe like me. Through the =proxy-wasm=
   spec implementation, Envoy is allowing embedded but securely isolated binary
   extension without the need to hack up the source. You can do this right now
   with SDKs in [[https://github.com/proxy-wasm/proxy-wasm-rust-sdk][Rust]] [[https://github.com/proxy-wasm/proxy-wasm-cpp-sdk][C++]], [[https://github.com/yskopets/envoy-wasm-assemblyscript-sdk][AssemblyScript]] and even early [[https://github.com/tetratelabs/proxy-wasm-go-sdk][Go]] support.

*** Example: Writing a HTTP Header Augmenting Filter
Earlier I was talking about functional building blocks offered to our platform
users. One such example is an injected sidecar that refreshes tokens from an IdP
and supplies them to the primary container, either via a UNIX file descriptor or
by POST'ing to a local HTTP endpoint. The primary container can subsequently use
the token in RPCs to upstream integrations without concerning itself with
token lifecycle.

#+attr_html: :alt Sidecar use case
[[./img/sidecar_full.png]]

> NOTE: There's absolutely no need to do this for inter-mesh RPCs of course.
Istio ([[https://spiffe.io/][SPIFFE]]) workload identity is state-of-the-art. The use case here is to
federate workload identity beyond the mesh itself across multiple network hops
e.g. to legacy on-premises services.

Now I should start by saying this /ain't broke/ and I'm not paid to fix things
that /ain't broke/ at work. We wrote it quickly and it does its thing.

On the other hand, it is objectively sub-optimal. For one, it is yet another
sidecar container. Worse than that, though, it puts the onus of responsibility
back on the product engineers to write code that either polls or uses
=inotify(7)= on that token file, or otherwise uses a dedicated HTTP handler to
receive the tokens.

-----

I had been revisiting Rust recently and so last weekend I wanted to see if I
could improve on this use case with an Envoy filter, using the nascent Rust
=proxy-wasm= SDK.

As it transpired, it is entirely possible to get rid of that additional sidecar
container and instead utilise the one sidecar container that cannot be gotten
rid of (Envoy) to procure, refresh and conditionally add the IdP token to
outbound HTTP headers.

So that's no additional platform sidecar overhead, no additional coding for
product engineers:

#+attr_html: :alt Sidecar-less use case
[[./img/sidecar_less.png]]

To prove the concept I implemented a generic HTTP filter that can augment
requests with additional headers automatically discovered from a 3rd party
endpoint at regular intervals. The full example is on [[https://github.com/martinbaillie/envoy-wasm-header-augmenting-filter][GitHub]] but I'll talk
through some key parts below.

> NOTE: the header-providing 3rd party service can be any configured Envoy
cluster. So in an Istio context, this could be another sidecar available over
loopback in the same pod, or some external centralised service perhaps in the
greater mesh authorising based on SPIFFE identity, or even outside of the mesh
authorising on Kubernetes service account token or cloud IAM for example, all
the while benefiting from circuit breakers, retries, load balancing and other
usual Istio-Envoy goodness.

**** Getting booted
I found the documentation sparse but the [[https://github.com/proxy-wasm/proxy-wasm-rust-sdk/blob/master/src/traits.rs][traits]] easy enough to decipher. The key
thing to know is there's seemingly 3 "Contexts" available:
1. Root
2. HTTP
3. Stream

Root is a singleton that should be initialised as the WASM VM boots. It is the
right place to setup shared data and timers. HTTP and Stream are called during
HTTP and TCP filter chains respectively, though I suspect the latter is more
nuanced than that. I only made use of the Root and HTTP contexts in my example.

To register context implementations there's the special =_start()= function called by the Envoy host when initialising.

#+begin_src rust
pub fn _start() {
    proxy_wasm::set_log_level(LogLevel::Trace);
    proxy_wasm::set_root_context(|context_id| -> Box<dyn RootContext> {
        CONFIGS.with(|configs| {
            configs
                .borrow_mut()
                .insert(context_id, FilterConfig::default());
        });

        Box::new(RootHandler { context_id })
    });
    proxy_wasm::set_http_context(|_context_id, _root_context_id| -> Box<dyn HttpContext> {
        Box::new(HttpHandler {})
    })
}
#+end_src

This is also seemed to be the most fitting place for me to set the log level.

**** Configuring the filter
For my configuration I created a [[https://github.com/serde-rs/json][Serde]] type to deserialise from JSON because JSON works best with how the host Envoy wants to do configuration.

#+begin_src rust
#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
#[serde(default)]
struct FilterConfig {
    /// The Envoy cluster name housing a HTTP service that will provide headers
    /// to add to requests.
    header_providing_service_cluster: String,

    /// The path to call on the HTTP service providing headers.
    header_providing_service_path: String,

    /// The authority to set when calling the HTTP service providing headers.
    header_providing_service_authority: String,

    /// The length of time to keep headers cached.
    #[serde(with = "serde_humanize_rs")]
    header_cache_expiry: Duration,
}
#+end_src

To get some configuration values into the filter there's an =on_configure()=
hook method called on the =RootContext= as the WASM VM boots, and this can be
married with the =get_configuration()= method for actually getting the configuration bytes.

**** Populating the token
Another useful method on the =RootContext= is =on_tick()= which is a ticker
controlled by =set_tick_period()=. I use it to dispatch calls to the header
providing endpoint (e.g. the IdP) on an interval.

#+begin_src rust
fn on_tick(&mut self) {
        // Log the action that is about to be taken.
        match self.get_shared_data(CACHE_KEY) {
            (None, _) => debug!("initialising cached headers"),
            (Some(_), _) => debug!("refreshing cached headers"),
        }

        CONFIGS.with(|configs| {
            configs.borrow().get(&self.context_id).map(|config| {
                ...
                // Dispatch an async HTTP call to the configured cluster.
                self.dispatch_http_call(
                    &config.header_providing_service_cluster,
                    vec![
                        (":method", "GET"),
                        (":path", &config.header_providing_service_path),
                        (":authority", &config.header_providing_service_authority),
                    ],
                    None,
                    vec![],
                    Duration::from_secs(5),
                )
                .map_err(|e| {
                    ...
                })
            })
        });
    }
#+end_src

However this is not your typical RPC. It is async from the caller's perspective and you have to play ball with Envoy's internal processing stack. The other side can be grabbed when the =on_http_call_response()= hook method triggers.

#+begin_src rust
fn on_http_call_response(
        &mut self,
        _token_id: u32,
        _num_headers: usize,
        body_size: usize,
        _num_trailers: usize,
    ) {
        // Gather the response body of previously dispatched async HTTP call.
        let body = match self.get_http_call_response_body(0, body_size) {
            Some(body) => body,
            None => {
                ...
            }
        };

        // Store the body in the shared cache.
        match self.set_shared_data(CACHE_KEY, Some(&body), None) {
            ...
        }
    }
}
#+end_src

**** Using shared data
The snippets above make passing reference to "shared data". There are facilities
in the =proxy-wasm= ABI for storing and retrieving data in a safe manner. In
this example I refresh the headers to be added to outbound requests on a
recurring tick, and cache them in shared data in the =RootContext=, out-of-band
from the HTTP filter chains.

The final piece of the puzzle is to retrieve the currently cached, to-be-inserted
headers during the hot path of an outbound request, and insert them into the
payload.

This is done on the =HttpContext=, when the =on_http_request_headers()= hook method triggers on the outbound request.

#+begin_src rust
impl HttpContext for HttpHandler {
    fn on_http_request_headers(&mut self, _num_headers: usize) -> Action {
        match self.get_shared_data(CACHE_KEY) {
            (Some(cache), _) => {
                debug!(
                    "using existing header cache: {}",
                    String::from_utf8(cache.clone()).unwrap()
                );

                match self.parse_headers(&cache) {
                    Ok(headers) => {
                        for (name, value) in headers {
                            self.set_http_request_header(&name, value.as_str())
                        }
                    }
                    ...
                }

                Action::Continue
            }
            ...

**** Deploying it
In the [[https://github.com/martinbaillie/envoy-wasm-header-augmenting-filter/tree/master/hack][hack directory]] I have a Docker compose stack complete with source,
destination and header providing containers, and an Envoy container configured
with the currently compiled filter. It mimics the Kubernetes/Istio pod network
setup and I found it useful for locally developing the filter.

Testing the real deal was a little trickier. Manually distributing the Envoy
filter binary to a test Kubernetes cluster such that it could be utilised by an
Istio =EnvoyFilter= resource necessitated jumping through a few hoops, but only
because I like making things difficult it seems. For the record there are
promising tools like Solo.io's [[https://docs.solo.io/web-assembly-hub/latest/reference/cli/wasme/][=wasme=]] suite and [[https://webassemblyhub.io/][AssemblyHub]] solving the filter
distribution problem. Additionally, with OCI registries like AWS's ECR starting
to support [[https://github.com/opencontainers/artifacts/blob/master/artifact-authors.md][OCI artifact types]], there is nothing stopping use of them as a WASM
module registry in addition to your typical OCI images.

Anyway, my approach was simply to use a =ConfigMap= to hold the WASM binary. The
=binaryData= field is esoteric but has actually existed since Kubernetes 1.10.
Doing it this way went a bit sideways when I realised the =ConfigMap= resource
has a size limit of 1mb, presumably hamstrung by =etcd= value limits, and my
un-optimised Rust compiler was producing WASM binaries in excess of that. What
followed was a few rounds of optimisation:
1. 2.1mb --> 1.7mb after reducing macro usage in the code.
2. 1.7mb --> 372kb when compiled with =lto=true= and =opt-level=s=.
3. 372kb --> 131kb when compiled through [[https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack][=wasm-pack=]].

Nice. That was more than enough for Kubernetes to accept my WASM binary as a
=ConfigMap=. I made use of Kustomize's [[https://github.com/martinbaillie/envoy-wasm-header-augmenting-filter/blob/master/hack/kustomization.yaml#L15-L17][files feature]] to do the serialisation on the fly.

-----

So now that the binary was in a binary =ConfigMap= in my cluster, I needed to
get it loaded into the target pod's Envoy. This is not as simple as editing a
=Deployment= spec's mounts because that Envoy is itself injected by Istio.

Fortunately there's a handy mount annotation that can be put on the =Deployment=
spec.

#+begin_src yaml
template:
  metadata:
    annotations:
      sidecar.istio.io/userVolumeMount: >
        '{ "filter":{"mountPath":"/etc/filter.wasm","subPath":"filter.wasm"} }'
#+end_src

This reflects in the injected Envoy container stanza. Then all you need is to mount the =ConfigMap= to the pod.

#+begin_src yaml
      volumes:
        - name: filter
          configMap:
            name: filter
#+end_src

With that done, the Envoy container has the custom filter available to its
userspace at =/etc/filter.wasm=. The final piece is to tell the Envoy process to
use it, and this is done by selecting it with an =EnvoyFilter= CRD loaded with
our custom configuration.

#+begin_src yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: EnvoyFilter
metadata:
  name: sourceworkload
spec:
  configPatches:

            filter:
              name: envoy.http_connection_manager
              subFilter:
                name: envoy.router
      patch:
        operation: INSERT_BEFORE
        value:
          config:
            config:
              configuration: |
                {
                  "header_providing_service_cluster": "inbound|8081|mgmt-8081|mgmtCluster",
                  "header_providing_service_authority": "localhost"
                }
              name: header_augmenting_filter
              rootId: header_augmenting_filter
              vmConfig:
                code:
                  local:
                    filename: /etc/filter.wasm
                runtime: envoy.wasm.runtime.v8
                allow_precompiled: true
          name: envoy.filters.http.wasm
  workloadSelector:
    labels:
      app: sourceworkload
#+end_src

In this example I am sliding the filter into the HTTP outbound chain and using
the existing =mgmt= cluster to call the header providing container over
loopback. As mentioned at the start of this section, there are many ways to skin
that cat.
** DONE Controlling Client SNI with Hyper :rust:hyper:security:
CLOSED: [2020-09-27 Sun 19:09]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: controlling-client-sni-with-hyper
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :tldr There is at least one way to take control of client SNI in Rust.
:END:
I recently revisited Rust after a few years hiatus and in one project I found
myself needing to provide a different Server Name Indicator (SNI) when
initiating a TLS connection to a remote host.

In Go this is as simple as setting the =ServerName= field on the standard
library's TLS configuration struct.
#+BEGIN_SRC go
(&http.Client{
    Transport: &http.Transport{
        TLSClientConfig: &tls.Config{
            ServerName: "somewhere.com",
        },
    },
}).Get("https://somewhere-else.com")
#+END_SRC

And is also what you can achieve with the =openssl= and =curl= CLIs for example.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
; openssl s_client -connect somewhere-else.com:443 -servername somewhere.com
; curl --resolve somewhere.com:443:<somewhere-else.com IP> https://somewhere.com
#+END_SRC

However, to my surprise, getting the equivalent in Rust was quite awkward. My
search for copypasta-able prior art failed to uncover anything usable and so I
thought I would document at least /one/ way of doing it, with [[https://github.com/hyperium/hyper][Hyper]], in case it
helps a future weary traveler.

#+begin_quote
My project actually started out higher up the abstraction stack with [[https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest][Reqwest]] but
at this level there's little in the way of control provided over the underlying
TLS settings. This forces dipping into the likes of Hyper.
#+end_quote

*** But why?
In my experience passing a different SNI is a somewhat typical requirement for
proxies doing virtual hosting or gateways doing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_fronting][domain fronting]].

In my particular case, I needed to send an HTTPS request to an [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/aws-privatelink.html][AWS PrivateLink]]
address but present a different SNI such that the application layer load
balancer on the other side of the link knew which certificate to present and how
to route the requests. I should note that I did not have the environmental
permissions to create a private DNS zone to CNAME or Alias the true hostname to
the PrivateLink one.

*** Hyper
You can achieve this feat with Hyper (and by extension Tokio) *but* I found I
needed to switch from the default TLS implementation to the Rust's native
OpenSSL bindings so I could link against =SSL_set_tlsext_host_name= in the FFI
of the build system's OpenSSL install.

In the [[https://docs.rs/crate/openssl/0.10.30][rust-openssl]] bindings library this corresponds to
[[https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.30/openssl/ssl/struct.SslRef.html#method.set_hostname][=openssl::ssl:SslRef::set_hostname()=]].

In addition to the bindings, you will also need to switch Hyper to use
[[https://docs.rs/hyper-openssl/0.8.1/hyper_openssl/][=hyper-openssl=]] crate.

In your =Cargo.toml= this looks something like:
#+BEGIN_SRC toml
[dependencies]
hyper = "0.13.8"
hyper-openssl = "0.8.0"
openssl = "0.10.30"
#+END_SRC

Then take control of the connector and set a callback as you construct your
Hyper client:
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
let mut conn = HttpsConnector::new()?;
conn.set_callback(move |c, _| {
    // Prevent native TLS lib from inferring and verifying a default SNI.
    c.set_use_server_name_indication(false);
    c.set_verify_hostname(false);

    // And set a custom SNI instead.
    c.set_hostname("somewhere.com")
});
Client::builder()
    .build::<_, Body>(conn)
    .request(Request::get("somewhere-else.com").body(())?)
    .await?;
#+END_SRC

That's it! If you capture the TLS =ClientHello= packet you can confirm the SNI
has changed:
#+attr_html: :alt WireShark TLS ClientHello
[[./img/client_hello_wireshark.png]]

*** Cross-platform builds
Using native OpenSSL is not without its pitfalls. YMMV with this but with my
attempts at statically linking for each target platform, even when I could get
the right incantations of the =OPENSSL_STATIC=, =OPENSSL_LIB_DIR= and
=OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR= variables to produce a true static binary from a =ldd=
perspective, I still found the bindings reaching for a system-provided OpenSSL
at runtime and subsequently segfaulting on Linux/amd64.

I eventually gave up with glibc and opted to use the musl libc counterparts.
However compiling musl versions of OpenSSL, zlib and friends is itself a rabbit
hole I did not have time for. Fortunately someone did and I can highly recommend
[[https://github.com/clux/muslrust][=clux/muslrust=]] container image for getting this task done.

I also had some issues with the binary being unable to find the CA certificates
on the host system. Solving this was easy thanks to the handy [[https://docs.rs/openssl-probe/0.1.2/openssl_probe/][=openssl-probe=]]
crate.
** DONE Git Signature Operations via HashiCorp Vault :vault:git:security:release:
CLOSED: [2020-10-04 Sun 12:59]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: git-signature-operations-via-hashicorp-vault
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :tldr Vaultsign is a helper tool for performing Git signature operations using Vault.
:END:
The typical modern software supply chain starts with an input changeset of
source commits triggering a whole raft of manual and automated code checks in a
CI environment: peer reviews; full testing pyramid; dependency vetting;
automated static analysis and so on.

The outputs of this step are invariably deployable artefacts such as binaries,
container images, interpreted/byte code archives or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code][IaC]] that subsequently need
to progress their way through a delivery pipeline comprising at least a
pre-production/staging environment (again, typically) before landing in
production.

To achieve that last part necessitates putting the production-bound artefacts on
/ice/ (object store, OCI registry, SCM repository tag etc.) whilst instances of
it are validated in the N pre-production environments in the delivery pipeline.
This is fine for most organisations, but an additional code provenance strategy
is sometimes required in regulated and other high security environments.

*** Code Provenance
My definition of code provenance here is the proof that those artefacts
deployed to production have been through all prior CI and pre-production steps,
and have additionally retained authenticity and integrity whilst in cold storage
between environments. Sort of like a software /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_custody][chain of custody]]/.

The tried and tested approach is to manually sign a checksum of the artefacts
and verify at each stage. This is a concise way to check integrity and
authenticity in one shot, but starts to fall down in modern automated contexts
because of the key distribution and identity problem. That is, an organisation's
engineers can still sign individual commits with their own keys, but it is
ultimately the identity of the automated CI environment that is collating and
producing the deployable artefacts.

So with identified engineers landing commits, the next link in that chain of
custody is the CI system. It needs to prove it was /responsible/ for producing
those deployable artefacts, and the following runtime stages needing to verify
that fact.

-----

There are many options in this space but generally speaking it involves the CI
system following the same approach as would have been followed by a human:
produce and sign a checksum of the deployable artefacts. This time, however,
there is the added complexity of the CI system needing to securely identify
itself (machine-to-machine) to some signing service, or otherwise storage
service in order to access the asymmetric key material needed for signing.

Checksumming strategies can further benefit from reproducible (aka.
deterministic) builds which are within reach these days with the right choice of
language and build system. Then there are specifications like [[https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md#the-update-framework-specification][The Update
Framework (TUF)]] laying foundations for securely tracking origin authenticity,
with tools like [[https://www.vaultproject.io/][Vault]], [[https://docs.docker.com/notary/getting_started/][Notary]], [[https://www.openpolicyagent.org/][OPA]]/[[https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper][Gatekeeper]], and cloud services like [[https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization][GCP
Binary Authorization]], and [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/api/Welcome.html][AWS Signer]] all able to help in this regard.

*** Vault
This post is about using HashiCorp's Vault in the previously outlined context of
code provenance.

With a Vault deployment there are numerous machine authentication options that a
CI system's agents can leverage to securely identify themselves, including but
not exclusive to: all major cloud IAM; Kubernetes SAs; AppRole; JWT/OIDC; or TLS
certificates.

Once authenticated, the agents can utilise Vault's "encryption as a service"
related backends and plugins ([[https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/transit][=transit=]], [[https://github.com/LeSuisse/vault-gpg-plugin][=gpg=]]) to sign checksums or raw data.

This constitutes as quite a strong code provenance strategy especially given
Vault's additional RBAC and audit features, provided the subsequent steps in the
software supply chain (... /of custody/) have the requisite network access to
the non-sensitive verify endpoints (or otherwise cached public key).

------

While the process outlined works well for deployable artefacts like binaries,
things get more awkward when some or all of the deployment collateral is say,
interpreted IaC files (Terraform, Pulumi etc.). In my experience, these are
commonly located on and directly deployed from a branch or tag, both of which
are of course /*mutable*/.

A solution here is to tarball all the IaC files and sign/store/verify them like
the other artefacts, or even just sign/store/verify the branch head commit or
tag SHA.

Another is to make use of a tool I am releasing today called [[https://github.com/martinbaillie/vaultsign][=vaultsign=]]!

*** Vaultsign

=vaultsign= is a small CLI that can be used as a Git helper to sign (and verify)
commits and tags using HashiCorp’s Vault.

It does so by implementing just enough of the GPG CLI interface and status
protocol to proxy the Git originating sign and verify requests onwards to your
specified Vault endpoint, and works with both the previously mentioned [[https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/transit][transit
backend]] and [[https://github.com/LeSuisse/vault-gpg-plugin][GPG plugins]] you may already be using for other code provenance
purposes.

With it, the CI system can sign a commit or, more commonly, a release tag at the
same time and using the same role and key material as the other deployable
artefacts in the release. Then they can then all be verified together during the
subsequent runtime steps in the chain. All the usual signature related Git
porcelain continues to function and you can even have forges like GitHub verify
and show the coveted green tick if you take the Vault GPG plugin option.

**** Example Usage
#+begin_src sh
# Login to vault.
; export VAULT_ADDR=https://production.vault.acme.corp
; vault login

# Tell git to use vaultsign.
; git config --local gpg.program /path/to/vaultsign

# Sign a commit and tag.
; export VAULT_SIGN_PATH=transit/sign/test/sha2-256
; git commit -m "test signed commit" -S
; git tag -m "test signed tag" -s test

# Verify the same commit and tag.
; export VAULT_VERIFY_PATH=transit/verify/test
; git verify-commit HEAD
; git log -1 --show-signature
; git verify-tag test

** DONE Avoiding Libinput Hysteresis on a ThinkPad :nix:

:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :tldr Avoid triggering hysteresis with this one dirty trick.
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: avoiding-libinput-hysteresis-on-a-thinkpad
:END:

Making a touchpad work on Linux as well as it does on macOS/Windows. It's a
problem as old as time itself, or at least as old as the /"year of Linux on the
desktop"/ meme.

The days of calibrating obscure values that I don't fully understand on the old
X11 =synaptics= driver were supposed to be a thing of the past with =libinput=,
and to be fair they have been, /for the most part/. Things are definitely more
in tune with what you've come to expect from other OSes out of the box.

Unfortunately I seem to have landed myself a ThinkPad with a touchpad (clickpad)
revision that triggers a hysteresis in =libinput= unnecessarily, making it
difficult to conduct precise, narrow gestures (like carefully circling a small
number of pixels for example).

This is a core issue being [[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/issues/286][tracked]] by the =libinput= developers that is
prevalent in various ThinkPad revisions but not yet resolved. The gist seems to
be yet unexplained heuristics causing wobbling detection to trigger a hysteresis
instantly. This is probably a hard thing to fix and way beyond me. However,
turning off wobbling detection altogether is not. And while a quick, temporary
and dirty fix, it /does/ seem to help!

*** Disable wobbling detection
To do so requires a /very/ simple patch.
#+begin_src diff
--- a/src/evdev-mt-touchpad.c 2020-12-20 12:16:11.039665884 +1100

#+end_src

With this in place I no longer have hysteresis issues and haven't noticed any
negative effects of disabled wobbling protection.

Apply the above patch to a recent =libinput= source and compile then install in
a way that suits your OS.

**** Nix

Below is an excerpt from how I do both in my NixOS package overlays.

#+begin_src nix
nixpkgs.overlays = [
    (self: super: {
        libinput = super.libinput.overrideAttrs
            (o: { patches = o.patches ++ [ libinput.patch ]; });
    })
];
#+end_src

This means any Nix expression in my system making use of =libinput= gets my
patched version.

*** A note on Synaptics RMI4 over SMBus
As I was digging into this problem I realised that my ThinkPad's Synaptics
clickpad runs their RMI4 protocol. This is a native protocol that has had Linux
kernel support as of 4.6 and means you can ditch the HID/PS2 emulation
(=psmouse= module).

This should have been automatic for me but it seems my device's PnP ID is not in
the current kernel's [[https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dtor/input.git/tree/drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c#n164][list]]. I can force it with the kernel parameter
=psmouse.synaptics_intertouch=1= but then it seems I then hit another [[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/issues/402][issue]] in
=libinput= that causes my clickpad buttons to not get discovered by the probing
code.

Alas, the situation is still good enough that I don't need to reach for the
=synaptics= driver, and there is better [[https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.10-Synaptics-RMI4-F3A][support]] landing in the 5.10 kernels so
I'm happy to hold out for now.

*** Cattle not pets
The majority of AWS EC2 I need to operate these days are members of Kubernetes
clusters. For remote access to them I'm more commonly authenticating to the Kube
API to spawn a privileged ephemeral debugger pod rather than accessing the host
directly. I have little need for host access even for the remaining minority of
ancillary EC2 services I'm responsible for because all the observability pillars
are pulled or pushed somewhere else, and if something is misbehaving or needing
replaced I'm more likely to shoot it than debug or patch it.

To be clear, I think this is a good thing. It is a testament to the efficacy of
the immutable infrastructure pattern, infrastructure as code and modern platform
tooling.

So the preface here is I rarely need to pop a shell on an EC2 instance, and
*very* rarely need to extract a file from one.

However, one of these very rare occurrences presented itself last week and
prompted my writing of this quick [[/wrote/fieldnotes][fieldnote]], if for no one else but myself!

*** AWS SSM
For a good wee while now, AWS SSM (or AWS Systems Manager as I see they are
calling it nowadays) has arguably been the most secure way to permit controlled
and audited access to an EC2 instance.

#+begin_quote
NOTE: You can also run the SSM agent on other cloud or on-premises VMs. I have
used to the latter in a hybrid context to good effect at a previous client. For
the former, most other clouds have their own solutions and those are probably
the smarter choice.
#+end_quote

If you /are/ in AWS then some features to like about the SSM approach over
traditional SSH are:
- No direct network path required. There is no need to punch holes in your
  VPC layers and chain bastions.
- Instance authentication controlled through IAM and by extension whichever IdP
  you may be federating human access with.
- Initial access and every userspace command audited and logged. To create
  break-glass alerts or "taint" instances that have been accessed is a breeze.

When compared to an SSH session there is no notable performance difference when
accessing an instance over the SSM APIs either. I do recall some lag in the
early days of the service but that seems fixed if you're doing run-of-the-mill
sysadmin things. Just don't go pasting many megabytes of junk into the pty from
your clipboard!

The only downside I feel is the need for an opaque client-side binary called the
[[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html][=ssm-session-manager-plugin=]] which is paired with the =aws= CLI (presuming you
want to use your terminal rather than a window in the AWS console).

#+begin_quote
NOTE: I packaged the plugin binary for Nix/NixOS a while back. It's currently
in [[https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=ssm-session-manager-plugin&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&query=ssm-session-manager-plugin][stable]].
#+end_quote

*** SSH
Perhaps more interesting, though, is that for the last couple of years AWS has
supported tunneling the SSH protocol over their SSM APIs if you use the SSM
"document" called =AWS-StartSSHSession=.

They do this by proxying the SSH data arriving at the =amazon-ssm-agent= on the
target host laterally to the =sshd= on the same host over loopback. So while
this means you need to run an SSH daemon again, you only need to bind it on a
local interface.

As above, there's not much to be gained for an interactive SSH session (that I'm
aware of) since the SSM sessions are good enough performance wise. Plus, you
actually lose a fair amount of the benefits listed above and you have the hassle
of getting your public key into the target host user's =authorized_keys= if it's
not already baked in.

What it /does/ do, however, is open up =scp=! You can now copy files to and fro
that target host which is something you couldn't do before with a pure SSM
session.

**** How?
Presuming your public key is already trusted by the target user on the host, all
you need to do is to modify your local SSH config (normally =~/.ssh/config=) to
tell it to proxy all session requests headed towards AWS instance names via the
AWS CLI.
#+begin_src sh
host i-* mi-*
ProxyCommand sh -c "aws ssm start-session \
    --target %h \
    --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession \
    --parameters 'portNumber=%p'"
#+end_src

With that done, and with an IAM session in tow, you can =ssh
user@i-00deadbeef= or =scp user@i-00deadbeef=.

#+begin_quote
NOTE: It's not the scope of this post, but you could conceivably configure SSH
tunnels here as well. There's also a =AWS-StartPortForwardingSession= document
that uses pure SSM to similar effect, and is probably more optimised.
#+end_quote
*** Emacs TRAMP
My work scenario from mid-week had me copying files to and from different
locations on an EC2 instance. Fortunately I tried good old TRAMP mode on a whim
and learned that it works flawlessly using SSH proxied over SSM (I am not sure
why I was surprised by that).

In a stock Emacs, =C-x C-f /ssh:user@i-00deadbeef:path= can be used to pop a
remote Dired directory buffer or edit a target file in whatever major mode is
appropriate.

#+attr_html: :alt TRAMP Dired
[[./img/tramp_dired.png]]

You can also move around the remote filesystem as if it were local, and the
likes of =M-x dired-do-copy= and friends can be used to transparently copy files
between local and remote.
