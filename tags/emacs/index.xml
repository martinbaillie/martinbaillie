For remote access to them I&amp;rsquo;m more commonly authenticating to the Kube API to spawn a privileged ephemeral debugger pod rather than accessing the host directly. I have little need for host access even for the remaining minority of ancillary EC2 services I&amp;rsquo;m responsible for because all the observability pillars are pulled or pushed somewhere else, and if something is misbehaving or needing replaced I&amp;rsquo;m more likely to shoot it than debug or patch it.</description></item><item><title>Emacs Evil Motion Training</title><link>https://martin.baillie.id/wrote/evil-motion-training-for-emacs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2020 10:33:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://martin.baillie.id/wrote/evil-motion-training-for-emacs/</guid><description>I made the switch to Emacs last year after having been a resolute vim user ever since I dual booted Slackware on my family&amp;rsquo;s first computer as an early teen.
