However, until now the configuration was not particularly idiomatic due to there being no upstream Tailscale Nix expressions in nixpkgs.
As it transpired, Dan Anderson of Tailscale is also a NixOS user and with his support I was able to shepherd in a quick PR to introduce a Tailscale module.</description></item><item><title>Tailscale Support for OpenBSD</title><link>https://martin.baillie.id/wrote/tailscale-support-for-openbsd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 20:29:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://martin.baillie.id/wrote/tailscale-support-for-openbsd/</guid><description>Tailscale A service called Tailscale launched at the beginning of the month and promises to be the &amp;ldquo;easiest, most secure way to use WireGuard and 2FA&amp;rdquo;.
As an early beta tester of WireGuard and someone who has been carefully tracking its progress towards mainline Linux (currently in net-next, scheduled for 5.6!), I am especially excited to see people much smarter than me start to build next generation VPN businesses centred around it.</description></item></channel></rss>
