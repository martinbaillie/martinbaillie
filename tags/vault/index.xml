The outputs of this step are invariably deployable artefacts such as binaries, container images, interpreted/byte code archives or IaC that subsequently need to progress their way through a delivery pipeline comprising at least a pre-production/staging environment (again, typically) before landing in production.</description></item><item><title>Ephemeral GitHub Tokens via HashiCorp Vault</title><link>https://martin.baillie.id/wrote/ephemeral-github-tokens-via-hashicorp-vault/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2020 08:39:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://martin.baillie.id/wrote/ephemeral-github-tokens-via-hashicorp-vault/</guid><description>GitHub I have found that performing automation against GitHub APIs often necessitates the creation of OAuth Tokens (nb. GitHub refers to these as Personal Access Tokens or PATs). These tokens are tied to a user account, have very coarsely-scoped permissions and do not expire.
The more automation-savvy users in an organisation will likely have created many such tokens with powerful permissions which are being neither rotated nor deleted.
The organisation will also commonly have wasted at least one of their GitHub seats on a robot/machine user for CI/CD purposes.</description></item></channel></rss>
